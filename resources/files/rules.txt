A player throws two dice and scores as many points as the total shown 
on the dice. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points 
or end his turn.

If a player rolls a 1, the player's turn is over and loses all points 
accumulated that turn.

If a player rolls two 1s, the player's turn is over and the player 
loses all points that the player has accumulated throughout the entire 
game.

A winner is decided when a player has accumulated 100 or more points
